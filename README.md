# ChicagoFoodInspection

This is a simple iOS application for user to get inspections information about all the restaurants in Chicago area, such as risk level, violations descriptions, recommendations and etc.

All data stored in the phone by using core data. 




### This project is a team-based project from one of my classes. In this project, I mainly focused on parsing data and created entities and stored data into Core data. Also some related works with UI design and link to iPhone default map to get directions from user's location to where they want to visit.
